# Woody Click
A web application inspired by the game Cookie Clicker. Your task is simple, click on a tree to amass the highest score! As you progress through the game, your point-earning potential will plateau. By donating to the Team Trees initiative through the WoodyClick website, you can break free from the plateau.
